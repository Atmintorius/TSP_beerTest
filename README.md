# TSP_beerTest

The main task of this Beer Test is to find the best route in order to visit as many beer factories and collect as many beer types as it is possible with 2000 km fuel for helicopter
and travel back to primary home destinantion.

In this code the nearest-nieghbour algorithm is implemented.

Yet there are things to be improved such as the coding style, OOP princples, git versioning, UI but the main functionality works fine and enough fast.

Python version: 3.8.5
